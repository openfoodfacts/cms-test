As a producer, the most efficient way to add packaging data to your products is by filling in this excel spreadsheet the necessary information, from column "AU".

For each packaging component, you will need to enter:

- The number of units (ex: 4 pots of yogurts)

- The shape (ex: pot, lid, box, etc)

- The material (ex: PET, paper, glass, etc)

- The recycling instruction (ex: to recycle, to discard, etc)

- The weight of one empty unit (in gr)

- The net quantity of product contained per unit

This spreadsheet can then be imported into our platform dedicated to professionals.
