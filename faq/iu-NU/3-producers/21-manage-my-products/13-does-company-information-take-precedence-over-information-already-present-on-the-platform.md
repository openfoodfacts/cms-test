When a producer places one of his products online with his producer account and a product sheet already exists, this will complete it.

The information that the producer will have posted will always have priority and he alone will be able to modify his products when the information is filled in.

If the data sent via the platform is fragmented, the information added by the community from the packaging may complete it.
