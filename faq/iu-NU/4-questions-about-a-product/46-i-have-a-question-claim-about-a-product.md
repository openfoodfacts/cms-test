https://world.openfoodfacts.org is a collaborative site created and fed by consumers to be able to decipher labels and compare products.

For more information about a product or a claim, write to the manufacturer. We do not have contact information for manufacturers but they are most often on the packaging.If you want to help us bring more transparency to consumers like you or us, you can use our iPhone or Android app to add products: https://openfoodfacts.appAnd to discuss about the project, you can join the Facebook group of contributors: https://www.facebook.com/groups/openfoodfacts/ or chat with the other contributors on Slack:
