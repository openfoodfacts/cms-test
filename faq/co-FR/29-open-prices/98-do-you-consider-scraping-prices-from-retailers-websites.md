For legal and technical reasons, we don’t consider scraping prices from retailers’ websites as a valid way to contribute to Open Prices. We want to make sure that the prices we collect are accurate and up-to-date, and receiving scraped prices from contributors doesn’t allow us to do that.

U scraping di i prezzi hè una opzione cunsiderata in una versione futura di Open Prices, ma seria fatta da Open Prices stessa in modu da pudè avè una prova di u prezzu basata annantu à a pagina HTML.
