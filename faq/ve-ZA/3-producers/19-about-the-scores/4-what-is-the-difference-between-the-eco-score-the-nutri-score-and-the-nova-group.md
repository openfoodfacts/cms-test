The purpose of these indicators is to provide easy-to-understand information for the consumer.

The NOVA group deals with the transformation of the product, theEco-Score with its environmental impact and the Nutri-Score with the nutritional elements, knowing that the more a product has scores close to A, the more qualitative it is.

The 3 scores do not deal with the same elements. It is therefore not possible to compare them with each other.
