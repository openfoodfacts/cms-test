## How can I add my packaging data to Open Food Facts?

As a producer, the most efficient way to add packaging data to your products is by filling in this [excel spreadsheet](https://world.pro.openfoodfacts.org/cgi/generate_sample_import_file.pl) the necessary information, from column "AU".

For each packaging component, you will need to enter:

- The number of units (ex: **4** pots of yogurts)

- The shape (ex: **pot, lid, box, etc**)

- The material (ex: **PET, paper, glass, etc**)

- The recycling instruction (ex: **to recycle, to discard, etc**)

- The weight of one empty unit (in gr)

- The net quantity of product contained per unit

This spreadsheet can then be imported into our platform dedicated to professionals.

## What is the Tackling Food Packaging project?

The "Tackling Food Packaging" project consists of collecting detailed information on the packaging of the most consumed products (shape, material, sorting instructions, weight, capacity).

Based on a participatory science approach, it will rely both on companies agreeing to share their packaging data and to play the game of transparency, and on citizens allowing the collection of information on products. This information will be freely reusable ("open data").

## Even after the end of the Tackling Food Packaging project, can I still add my packaging data?

Even after the end of the project, it is possible to add packaging data as the packaging fields will remain on our website.
