## I would like to add a new logo for labels

Here is the process:

- find the **canonical name** of the label in the [labels' taxonomy](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-server/blob/main/taxonomies/labels.txt) (it's the first item in the list of the labels' synonyms, eg. en:100% vegetable)
-

**get the logo in a good quality**: avoid using the contributor's photo which are not suited for this case; most labels have official websistes high quality logos, sometimes in vector format (even better for us); as long as we use a logo to objectively inform about the presence of a
label on the packaging of a product, there is no need to ask permission.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**name the file like this**:   name-of-the-label.[width]x90.png  where width is the width for the logo when it is 90 pixels high. The filenames need to be unaccented, in lowercase and using "-" instead of spaces.

- then add the logo in the directory that corresponds to its canonical name. If the canonical name is en:something, then they need to be in /en/. The root directory for logos is [https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-server/tree/main/html/images/lang](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-server/tree/main/html/images/lang)
