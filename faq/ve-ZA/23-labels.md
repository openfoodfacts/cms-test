As a label, as you are not the direct producer of the products, you do not need to create a producer’s account.

## I am a label, how can I participate in the project?

As a label the most relevant thing to do is to contact us **(producers@openfoodfacts.org)** and send us the list of the products on which your label is displayed so that we can add them on the related product sheets.
