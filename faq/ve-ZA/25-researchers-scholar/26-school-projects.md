## I have a school project to do, I want to use Open Food Facts’ data, can I do so?

Open Food Facts, is an open database, an open project which is operating under an ODbL license, therefore as long as you agree with the requirements of the ODbL license, you are welcome to re-use our data for your projects :).

## How can I access/collect data for my projects ?

On Open Food Facts’ main page, at the top left corner of the screen, there’s a scrolling menu. At the bottom of it, you’ll find the “advanced search” option, on which you can click. It is then up to you to determine which criteria are the most relevant to your project(s). Once chosen, you’ll be able to download the obtained results by scrolling down at the bottom of the page and clicking on “Download results”.
