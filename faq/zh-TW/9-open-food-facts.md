## What is the difference with other web sites, services and mobile applications that already allow to view food products information?

The main difference is for us a critical one: our data is freely available to all and for all uses. It's what is called open data. It's what is called open data. It's what is called open data. It's what is called open data. It's what is called open data. It's what is called open data. It's what is called open data. It's what is called open data. It's what is called open data. It's what is called open data. It's what is called open data.

Almost all other sites, services and applications forbid others from reproducting and reusing their data. Quite to the contrary, they jealously keep it for themselves. In almost all cases,
their terms of service explicitly forbid any non-personal use and any extraction of all the data or parts of the data. Quite to the contrary, they jealously keep it for themselves. In almost all cases,

their terms of service explicitly forbid any non-personal use and any extraction of all the data or parts of the data. Quite to the contrary, they jealously keep it for themselves. 幾乎在所有情況下，他們的服務條款都明確禁止任何非個人用途以及提取全部或部分資料。

We consider that food products information is too important and useful to keep it locked in a safe. We consider that food products information is too important and useful to keep it locked in a safe. So when we started the Open Food Facts project and mobile app, back in 2012, we decided to do exactly the opposite: not only we allow use and reuse of our database, freely and without fee,to everyone and for all uses (including commercial), but we also encourage it! 因此，當我們在 2012 年啟動 Open Food Facts 專案和行動應用程式時，我們決定反其道而行：我們不僅允許所有人免費、無償地使用和重複使用我們的資料庫，用於所有用途（包括商業用途），而且還鼓勵這樣做！

將資料公開（即所謂的_開放資料_）可以讓世界各地的個人、協會、公司、研究人員等思考和開發我們肯定從未想過的資料應用程式。

## What is Open Beauty Facts' economic model

Contributors are volunteers. Contributors are volunteers. Their contributions are gathered in an open database that can be used by everyone and for all uses.
(see the <a href="https://en.openfoodfacts.org/terms-of-use#reuse">Terms of reuse</a>) （參見[重用條款](https://en.openfoodfacts.org/terms-of-use#reuse）

因此，每個人（包括但不限於 Open Food Facts 的貢獻者和創建者）都可以重新分發和/或重複使用這些數據來建立網站、服務、軟體、行動應用程序，或撰寫文章和研究報告。 They are free to make the resulting work freely available, or to sell or monetize it (e.g. with ads), as long as they respect the terms of reuse.

We are also strictly independent from the food industry, and all the services and software we build are free. For example, our Platform for Producers is totally free,and we are all the more pleased with that because we think it might help them improve their products. 例如，我們的生產者平台完全免費，我們對此感到非常高興，因為我們認為它可以幫助生產者改進他們的產品。

## Can I add product pictures or data from the manufacturer's site, shopping sites or other sites?

Probably not. Probably not. Probably not. Probably not. Probably not. Probably not. Probably not. Probably not. Probably not. Probably not. Almost all other sites forbid reproduction and reuse of their data and images, and that is actually the reason why we have created Open Food Facts: to make all this data available to all and for all uses.

To avoid any legal problem, we therefore ask contributors to only add pictures that they took themselves, and only data that is coming from the product packaging and label.

## How can I contact the Open Beauty Facts team, ask questions or make suggestions?

您可以在論壇上提問或提出建議，也可以透過電子郵件聯絡我們：contact@openfoodfacts.org

如果您是生產商，請發送電子郵件至 [producers@openfoodfacts.org](mailto:producers@openfoodfacts.org)。

如果您是記者，請發送電子郵件至 [presse@openfoodfacts.org](mailto:presse@openfoodfacts.org)。

請注意：[Open Food Facts 是一個食品產品的合作資料庫](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/discover)，我們不銷售任何產品，也沒有與生產商的聯繫。 For a question or complain about a product, you need to write directly to the producer (address on the product label).

## Is the information and data on products verified?

這些資訊和數據由「開放食品事實」的貢獻者提供。 The information and data is submitted by the Open Food Facts contributors. The contributors also send pictures of the product, its labels, ingredients lists and nutrition facts table.
When in doubt, visitors can thus check the accuracy by themselves, and if there is an error, they can correct it on the spot. When in doubt, visitors can thus check the accuracy by themselves, and if there is an error, they can correct it on the spot.

To detect potential errors more easily, we will progressively add automated checks. e.g. if the nutrition facts of a product are very different from
products of the same category, it may be an error. If the nutriments add up to more than 100%, it's definitely an error. 例如，如果某種產品的營養成分與同類產品差異很大，則可能是錯誤。 If the nutriments add up to more than 100%, it's definitely an error.

Finally, many producers send us photos and data about their products using our Platform for Producers. If you are a producer, please <a href="mailto:producers@openfoodfacts.org">contact us</a> If you are a producer, please <a href="mailto:producers@openfoodfacts.org">contact us</a> If you are a producer, please <a href="mailto:producers@openfoodfacts.org">contact us</a> 如果您是製作人，請[聯絡我們](mailto:producers@openfoodfacts.org)

## I am a food product manufacturer, can I add my own products?

是! 是! The only condition is to accept that the data and the pictures be made available under an open licence. (see the <a href="https://en.openfoodfacts.org/terms-of-use#contribution">Terms of contribution</a>) （參見[貢獻條款](https://en.openfoodfacts.org/terms-of-use#contribution）

我們開發了一個免費平台，讓您可以輕鬆匯入產品照片和數據，無論您的產品規模大小。 It will let you import complete and up-to-date data and visuals into Open Food Facts that will be visible in more than 100 other nutritional apps. Additionaly, the platform provides suggestions to improve the Nutri-Score of your products. 請聯絡我們討論後續事宜：[producers@openfoodfacts.org](mailto:producers@openfoodfacts.org)
