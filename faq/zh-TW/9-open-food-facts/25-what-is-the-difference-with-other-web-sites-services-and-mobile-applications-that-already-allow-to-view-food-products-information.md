The main difference is for us a critical one: our data is freely available to all and for all uses. It's what is called open data. It's what is called open data. It's what is called open data.

Almost all other sites, services and applications forbid others from reproducting and reusing their data. Quite to the contrary, they jealously keep it for themselves. In almost all cases,
their terms of service explicitly forbid any non-personal use and any extraction of all the data or parts of the data. Quite to the contrary, they jealously keep it for themselves. In almost all cases,

So when we started the Open Food Facts project and mobile app, back in 2012, we decided to do exactly the opposite: not only we allow use and reuse of our database, freely and without fee,to everyone and for all uses (including commercial), but we also encourage it! 因此，當我們在 2012 年啟動 Open Food Facts 專案和行動應用程式時，我們決定反其道而行：我們不僅允許所有人免費、無償地使用和重複使用我們的資料庫，用於所有用途（包括商業用途），而且還鼓勵這樣做！

將資料公開（即所謂的開放資料）可以讓世界各地的個人、協會、公司、研究人員等思考和開發我們肯定從未想過的資料應用程式。
