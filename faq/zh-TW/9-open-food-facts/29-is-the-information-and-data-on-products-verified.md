這些資訊和數據由「開放食品事實」的貢獻者提供。 The information and data is submitted by the Open Food Facts contributors. The contributors also send pictures of the product, its labels, ingredients lists and nutrition facts table.
When in doubt, visitors can thus check the accuracy by themselves, and if there is an error, they can correct it on the spot. When in doubt, visitors can thus check the accuracy by themselves, and if there is an error, they can correct it on the spot.

To detect potential errors more easily, we will progressively add automated checks. e.g. if the nutrition facts of a product are very different from
products of the same category, it may be an error. If the nutriments add up to more than 100%, it's definitely an error. 例如，如果某種產品的營養成分與同類產品差異很大，則可能是錯誤。 If the nutriments add up to more than 100%, it's definitely an error.
