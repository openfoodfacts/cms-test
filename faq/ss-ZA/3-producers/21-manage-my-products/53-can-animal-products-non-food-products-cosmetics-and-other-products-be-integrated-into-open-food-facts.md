We have created specific projects for cosmetics, for animal feed, as well as for other products:[Open Beauty Facts](https://world.openbeautyfacts.org/),[Open Pet Food Facts](https://world.openpetfoodfacts.org/)and[Open Products Facts](https://world.openproductsfacts.org/)respectively.
We are therefore happy to be able to import your products into the project that suits them.
