## What is the Eco-Score methodology?

The Eco-Score is based on the calculation of the life cycle analysis produced by ADEME (the ecological transition agency) and INRAE (the national institute for agronomic research). About fifteen components are calculated and linked to create the PEF score.

To this PEF score are added bonuses and maluses (mode of production, origin of

ingredients, endangered species, packaging) in order to calculate the Eco-Score.

For more information, see the summary page [https://world.openfoodfacts.org/eco-score-the-environmental-impact-of-food-products](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/eco-score-the-environmental-impact-of-food-products) on Open Food Facts as well as on the Eco-Score consortium website.

## What type of information must be given for the Eco-Score to be calculated as accurately as possible?

For the Eco-Score to be calculated exactly, the percentage of each ingredient and its origin must be specified.

If this information is not already specified in the list of ingredients, you can add a column to mention it, with the following format:

Wheat flour 16% (France)

Chocolate 8% (Ivory Coast, Ecuador)

We need also the components of the packaging in the form of: 1 plastic film to throw away, 1 FSC cardboard box to recycle, 6 PET transparent plastic bottles of 1.5 L to recycle, 6 opaque colored plastic caps, 12 plastic cans 33 cl aluminum.

## How are the values ​​of the 15 indicators combined?

**To better understand the PEF system, you can read: explanation of the PEF score on the Eco-Score methodological site**

## Does the local aspect concern the place of manufacture or the place of origin of the raw materials?

**The local aspect concerns the origin of the raw materials. This is why it is important to enter their percentages as well as their origins in the list of product ingredients or in the field dedicated to the origins of ingredients.**

## How to enter the origins of ingredients for the eco-score?

If you wish to share the information on the origin of the raw materials on your sheets, we invite you to include them in the list of ingredients.
