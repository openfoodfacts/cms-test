Any information you have is welcome, from nutritional information to packaging information.

This makes it possible to establish a complete file, to calculate all the scores with precision and more generally a transparency appreciated by consumers.

However we do recommend you prioritize the following fields:

- 营养信息
- Product category (e.g. drinks, cheese, yogurt, etc.)
- Name of the product
- Allergens
- and the ingredients, this field is not mandatory but recommended for an optimal usage and determination of the scores

→ For more details, we invite you to download our user guide and/or consult our video tutorials :-)
