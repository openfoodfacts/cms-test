If you want to remove a product that is no longer available on the market, you just have to check the box "this product is no longer sold" when you edit your product sheet.

If you want to remove several products, we recommend you follow the procedure mentioned in the user guide, on p. 18.

You can also contact us via producers@openfoodfacts.org if you have any questions.

When the product is archived, it will no longer appear in Open Food Facts.It will however remain in our database so that we can keep a history of products sold over time.
