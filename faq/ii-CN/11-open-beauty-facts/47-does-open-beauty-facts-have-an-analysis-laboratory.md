Open Beauty Facts unfortunately does not have an analysis laboratory: we are an association of volunteers whose goal is to create a Wikipedia of cosmetics.

That said, if you would like to help us provide more transparency for

consumers, you can use our iPhone, Android and

Windows Phone to add products:
