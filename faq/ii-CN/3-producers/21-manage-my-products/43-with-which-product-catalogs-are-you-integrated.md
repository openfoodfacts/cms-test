Manufacturers can now send their product data and photos in real time from Equadis, AGENA3000 and BAYARD consulting to Open Food Facts.

You will of course also benefit from the reformulation suggestions and all the features of the platform.

Our blog post explains the steps to follow if you are an EQUADIS customer.

If you are an AGENA3000 customer (Product A3 PIM INDUSTRY), you just have to select the recipient "Open Food Facts" when sending your product sheets. More information on this blog post.

If you are a customer of another product data catalog (Salsify - ex-Alkemics, ConsoTrust, 1worldSync, Akeneo, PIMWorks, etc.) please let us know at producers@openfoodfacts.org
