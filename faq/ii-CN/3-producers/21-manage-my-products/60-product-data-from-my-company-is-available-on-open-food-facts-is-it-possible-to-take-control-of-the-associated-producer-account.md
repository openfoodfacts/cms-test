Yes of course! You can take control of the associated producer account by creating an Open Food Facts account with your business address. When you register, mention the name of the organization present on the form to be able to access the corresponding producer space.

A short validation step will be necessary to ensure that you are indeed the producer.

You will be able to complete the data, add images, obtain automatic recommendations for improving the Nutri-Score, and much more. All this is of course completely free. You can also connect a third-party product data management system such as EQUADIS , AGENA3000 and Bayard consulting.
