We use the barcode to identify products, if you import a record with the same barcode as an existing record, the information will be merged.

For data such as ingredient list, nutritional values (only one correct value possible), the data sent via the producer platform will overwrite the existing data.

For data such as labels/categories/brands (several correct values possible), the information is merged. If data is incorrect on the public platform, you can modify the product sheet on the public platform to remove the incorrect values.

→ For more details, we invite you to download our user guide and/or consult our video tutorials :-)
