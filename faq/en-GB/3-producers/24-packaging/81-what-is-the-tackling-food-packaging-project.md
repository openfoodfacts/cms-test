The "Tackling Food Packaging" project consists of collecting detailed information on the packaging of the most consumed products (shape, material, sorting instructions, weight, capacity).

Based on a participatory science approach, it will rely both on companies agreeing to share their packaging data and to play the game of transparency, and on citizens allowing the collection of information on products. This information will be freely reusable ("open data").
