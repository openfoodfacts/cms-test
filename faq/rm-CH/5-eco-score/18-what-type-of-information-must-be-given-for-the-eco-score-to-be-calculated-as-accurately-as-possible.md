For the Eco-Score to be calculated exactly, the percentage of each ingredient and its origin must be specified.

If this information is not already specified in the list of ingredients, you can add a column to mention it, with the following format:

Wheat flour 16% (France)

Chocolate 8% (Ivory Coast, Ecuador)

We need also the components of the packaging in the form of: 1 plastic film to throw away, 1 FSC cardboard box to recycle, 6 PET transparent plastic bottles of 1.5 L to recycle, 6 opaque colored plastic caps, 12 plastic cans 33 cl aluminum.
