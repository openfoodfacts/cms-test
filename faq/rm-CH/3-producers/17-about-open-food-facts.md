## What type of information should be shared?

Any information you have is welcome, from nutritional information to packaging information.

This makes it possible to establish a complete file, to calculate all the scores with precision and more generally a transparency appreciated by consumers.

However we do recommend you prioritize the following fields:

- Nutritional information

- Product category (e.g. drinks, cheese, yogurt, etc.)

- Name of the product

- Allergens

- and the ingredients, this field is not mandatory but recommended for an optimal usage and determination of the scores

## Can I download Open Food Facts data?

You can download all the data available on Open Food Facts. Beware, this requires a lot of disk space, a powerful computer if you want to use a spreadsheet or knowledge of R or Python otherwise.

You can also download a subset of the data (your brand for example) thanks to the advanced search.
