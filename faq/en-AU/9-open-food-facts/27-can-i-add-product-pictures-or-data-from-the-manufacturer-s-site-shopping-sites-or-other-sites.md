Probably not. Almost all other sites forbid reproduction and reuse of their data and images, and that's actually the reason why we are creating Open Beauty Facts: to make all this data available to all and for all uses.

To avoid any legal problem, we therefore ask contributors to only add pictures that they took themselves, and only data that is coming from the product packaging and label.
