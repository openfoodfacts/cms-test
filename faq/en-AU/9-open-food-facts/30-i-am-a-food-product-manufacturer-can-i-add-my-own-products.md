Yes! The only condition is to accept that the data and the pictures be made available under an open licence. (see the Terms of contribution)

We have developped a free platform to let you easily import photos and data about your products, regardless of your size. It will let you import complete and up-to-date data and visuals into Open Food Facts that will be visible in more than 100 other nutritional apps. Additionaly, the platform provides suggestions to improve the Nutri-Score of your products. Contact-us to discuss how we could proceed: producers@openfoodfacts.org
