Informationes et data a contributoribus Open Food Facts submittuntur. The contributors also send pictures of the product, its labels, ingredients lists and nutrition facts table. When in doubt, visitors can thus check the accuracy by themselves, and if there is an error, they can correct it on the spot.

To detect potential errors more easily, we will progressively add automated checks. Exempli gratia, si notitia nutritionis producti a productis eiusdem categoriae valde differt, error esse potest. If the nutriments add up to more than 100%, it's definitely an error.

Finally, many producers send us photos and data about their products using our Platform for Producers. Si productor es, nobiscum quaeso contactum fac.
