Contributors are volunteers. Their contributions are gathered in an open database that can be used by everyone and for all uses. (see the Terms of reuse)

Everyone (including but not limited to Open Food Facts contributors and creators) can thus redistribute and/or reuse the data to build web sites, services, software, mobile applications, or to write articles and studies. They are free to make the resulting work freely available, or to sell or monetize it (e.g. with ads), as long as they respect the terms of reuse.

We are also strictly independent from the food industry, and all the services and software we build are free. For example, our Platform for Producers is totally free, and we are all the more pleased with that because we think it might help them improve their products.
