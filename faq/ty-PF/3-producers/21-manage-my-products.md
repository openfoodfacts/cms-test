## What guarantees the quality of the data in Open Food Facts?

**To continuously improve the quality of the data we rely on 4 pillars:**

1. The community is constantly adding data and photos and is a veritable patrol of reviewers.

2. We have set logic rules to identify errors on the product sheets.For example: if the sum of the weight of the ingredients is greater than the total weight of the product, there is an anomaly. We have around 50 others quality checks.

3. Thanks to Machine Learning, we limit the risk of input errors. Our technology allows us to extract textual data from photos taken by contributors

4. Thanks to the support of Santé Publique France, we developed a portal allowing producers to upload their mass-produced data and thus correct/complete the community's contributions.

## How to add products?

To add products to our platform, you first need to decide how you want to proceed. There are 4 options:

- **Manually**: if you have a small number of products, it is still possible to create each product sheet by hand on the Pro Platform.

- **Via a spreadsheet import**: you can download the spreadsheet [template](https://world.pro.openfoodfacts.org/cgi/generate_sample_import_file.pl) provided by Open Food Facts, or import directly an extraction from your IT system into the Pro platform.

- **Via product catalogues' connectors**. If you are client at EQUADIS, AGENA3000 or BAYARD, you can upload data in Open Food Facts in 1 click. If you are working with another PIM (Product Information Management), please contact us : producers@openfoodfacts.org

- **Via a tailored connexion** between your company and Open Food Facts. If you count more than 1000 products in your portfolio, we can discuss the opportunity of build a specific connector to ease the data transfer.

For more details, we invite you to download our [user guide](https://blog.openfoodfacts.org/en/EN-Pro-Plateform-User-Guide.pdf) and/or consult our [video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjAH-USadsF3xgSVfUUBS4we3XBr-1r55) :-)

## Is there a way to automate product updates to the public database?

Yes, if you use EQUADIS, AGENA3000 or BAYARD product catalogues, and set up the right configuration, the import can be done automatically and therefore update the product data on Open Food Facts.

---

## Is the number of added products limited?

There is no limit, you can upload the number of products you want on our platform.

---

## Is it possible to delete products that are no longer sold?

If you want to remove a product that is no longer available on the market, you just have to check the box "this product is no longer sold" when you edit your product sheet.

If you want to remove several products, we recommend you follow the procedure mentioned in the [user guide](https://blog.openfoodfacts.org/en/EN-Pro-Platform-User-Guide.pdf), on p. 18.

You can also contact us via producers@openfoodfacts.org if you have any questions.

When the product is archived, it will no longer appear in Open Food Facts.It will however remain in our database so that we can keep a history of products sold over time.

---

## Does company information take precedence over information already present on the platform?

When a producer places one of his products online with his producer account and a product sheet already exists, this will complete it.

The information that the producer will have posted will always have priority and he alone will be able to modify his products when the information is filled in.

If the data sent via the platform is fragmented, the information added by the community from the packaging may complete it.

---

## In what format should I send my data?

A [template](https://world.pro.openfoodfacts.org/cgi/generate_sample_import_file.pl) is provided by Open Food Facts.

However, any spreadsheet format (xlsx, csv) will be importable in the platform.  
Our algorithm is designed to automatically match the attributes from your file, with the ones present in Open Food Facts. Beware to always double-check the matching stage as you may need to adjust manually some of them.

If your information is fragmented between several spreadsheets, you can import them consecutively - making sure to do the matching if the format changes.

You can also import an Excel file in addition to an EQUADIS or AGENA3000 import, if the data is not yet in your information system. In these cases, don't forget to request an export to the public database from the interface.

## With which product catalogs are you integrated?

Manufacturers can now send their product data and photos in real time from **Equadis,** **AGENA3000 and BAYARD consulting** to Open Food Facts.

You will of course also benefit from the reformulation suggestions and all the features of the platform.

[Our blog post](https://blog.openfoodfacts.org/en/news/real-time-product-data-from-producers-on-open-food-facts-thanks-to-the-new-equadis-integration) explains the steps to follow if you are an EQUADIS customer.

If you are an AGENA3000 customer (Product A3 PIM INDUSTRY), you just have to select the recipient "Open Food Facts" when sending your product sheets. [More information on this blog post](https://blog.openfoodfacts.org/en/news/share-your-product-data-in-1-click-with-the-new-agena3000-connector).

If you are a customer of another product data catalog (Salsify - ex-Alkemics, ConsoTrust, 1worldSync, Akeneo, PIMWorks, etc.) please let us know at [producers@openfoodfacts.org](mailto:producers@openfoodfacts.org)

## How to add products without barcodes via the Pro platform?

For products without a barcode, on the site or on the producer platform, there is a "Product without barcode" button in the left column which allows you to add them. An identifier is then generated automatically.

---

## Can animal products, non-food products, cosmetics and other products be integrated into Open Food Facts?

We have created specific projects for cosmetics, for animal feed, as well as for other products:Open Beauty Facts,Open Pet Food FactsandOpen Products Factsrespectively.
We are therefore happy to be able to import your products into the project that suits them.

---

## Product data from my company is available on Open Food Facts. Is it possible to take control of the associated producer account?

Yes of course! You can take control of the associated producer account by creating an Open Food Facts account with your business address. When you register, mention the name of the organization present on the form to be able to access the corresponding producer space.

A short validation step will be necessary to ensure that you are indeed the producer.

You will be able to complete the data, add images, obtain automatic recommendations for improving the Nutri-Score, and much more. All this is of course completely free. You can also connect a third-party product data management system such as EQUADIS , AGENA3000 and Bayard consulting.

## How long does it take for producer data to be updated on other app reusing Open Food Facts database?

It depends on the apps. For those that use our APIs, which is the vast majority, it is immediate.  
For the ones that use our daily exports, it's D+1 provided that they update it.

---

## Does importing the data from a product record complete or overwrite the existing product record?

We use the barcode to identify products, if you import a record with the same barcode as an existing record, the information will be merged.

For data such as ingredient list, nutritional values (only one correct value possible), the data sent via the producer platform will overwrite the existing data.

For data such as labels/categories/brands (several correct values possible), the information is merged. If data is incorrect on the public platform, you can modify the product sheet on the public platform to remove the incorrect values.

---

## Is the order of ingredients important?

The order of the ingredientsis important: it represents the order by quantity.
The best way to fill the ingredients is to follow exactly what is written on the packaging. That's why it is also so important to have photos of the ingredients printed.

---

## Can I send images via AGENA3000 too?

You can send images but in practice only the main image will be selected automatically, the other images will be sent, but not cropped / selected for ingredients, nutrition etc.

---
