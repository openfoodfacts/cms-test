The Eco-Score is based on the calculation of the life cycle analysis produced by ADEME (the ecological transition agency) and INRAE (the national institute for agronomic research). About fifteen components are calculated and linked to create the PEF score.

To this PEF score are added bonuses and maluses (mode of production, origin of

ingredients, endangered species, packaging) in order to calculate the Eco-Score.
