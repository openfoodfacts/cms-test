## Who is responsible for calculating the footprint and/or score?

The Nutri-Score, NOVA group and Eco-Score are calculated based on the data present in Open Food Facts. Our algorithms strictly follow the official methodologies of these scores.

## What is the difference between the Eco-Score, the Nutri-Score and the NOVA group?

The purpose of these indicators is to provide easy-to-understand information for the consumer.

The [NOVA group](https://fr.openfoodfacts.org/nova) deals with the transformation of the product, the[Eco-Score](https://fr.openfoodfacts.org/ecoscore) with its environmental impact and the [Nutri-Score](https://fr.openfoodfacts.org/nutriscore) with the nutritional elements, knowing that the more a product has scores close to A, the more qualitative it is.

The 3 scores do not deal with the same elements. It is therefore not possible to compare them with each other.

## Is it possible to simulate the Eco-Score or Nutri-Score of my products?

By registering on the producers' platform and upload your products' data, you can compute the Nutri-Score and Eco-Score associated with your products.



However, you must delete it once the simulation has been carried out so that it is not exported to the public platform with the products already marketed in your range.
