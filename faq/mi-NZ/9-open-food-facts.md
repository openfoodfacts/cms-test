## What is the difference with other web sites, services and mobile applications that already allow to view food products information?

The main difference is for us a critical one: our data is freely available to all and for all uses. It's what is called open data.

Almost all other sites, services and applications forbid others from reproducting and reusing their data. Quite to the contrary, they jealously keep it for themselves. I te nuinga o ngā wā, e ārai mārama ana ā rātou tikanga ratonga i tētahi whakamahinga kore-whaiaro me te tango i ngā raraunga katoa, i ētahi wāhanga rānei o ngā raraunga.

We consider that food products information is too important and useful to keep it locked in a safe. Nō reira, i te tīmatanga o te kaupapa Open Food Facts me te taupānga pūkoro, i te tau 2012, i whakatau mātou ki te mahi i te ritenga kē: ehara i te mea ka whakaaetia e mātou te whakamahi me te whakamahi anō i tā mātou pātengi raraunga, he kore utu, he kore utu hoki, ki te katoa, mō ngā whakamahinga katoa (tae atu ki ngā mahi arumoni), engari ka akiakihia hoki e mātou!

Mā te whakawātea i ngā raraunga ki te marea (e mōhiotia ana ko te _raraunga tuwhera_) ka taea e ngā tāngata takitahi, ngā rōpū, ngā kamupene, ngā kairangahau me ētahi atu o te ao te whakaaro me te whakawhanake i ngā tono mō ngā raraunga kāore rawa i whakaarohia e tātou.

## What is Open Food Facts' economic model

Contributors are volunteers. Their contributions are gathered in an open database that can be used by everyone and for all uses. (tirohia ngā [Ngā Tikanga Whakamahi Anō](https://en.openfoodfacts.org/terms-of-use#reuse))

Ka taea e te katoa (tae atu ki ngā kaituku me ngā kaihanga o Open Food Facts) te tohatoha anō me te whakamahi anō rānei i ngā raraunga hei hanga paetukutuku, ratonga, pūmanawa, taupānga pūkoro, hei tuhi tuhinga me ngā rangahau rānei. They are free to make the resulting work freely available, or to sell or monetize it (e.g. with ads), as long as they respect the terms of reuse.

We are also strictly independent from the food industry, and all the services and software we build are free. Hei tauira, he kore utu rawa tā mātou Pūhara mō ngā Kaihanga, ā, e nui atu ana tō mātou harikoa ki tēnā nā te mea e whakaaro ana mātou ka āwhina pea tēnei i a rātou ki te whakapai ake i ā rātou hua.

## Can I add product pictures or data from the manufacturer's site, shopping sites or other sites?

Probably not. Almost all other sites forbid reproduction and reuse of their data and images, and that is actually the reason why we have created Open Food Facts: to make all this data available to all and for all uses.

To avoid any legal problem, we therefore ask contributors to only add pictures that they took themselves, and only data that is coming from the product packaging and label.

---

## How can I contact the Open Food Facts team, ask questions or make suggestions?

Ka taea e koe te pātai, te tuku whakaaro rānei mō te wānanga, te whakapā mai rānei mā te īmēra: contact@openfoodfacts.org

Mena he kaihanga koe, tēnā īmēra mai ki a mātou ki [producers@openfoodfacts.org](mailto:producers@openfoodfacts.org).

Mena he kairīpoata koe, tēnā īmēra mai ki a mātou ki [presse@openfoodfacts.org](mailto:presse@openfoodfacts.org).

Kia mōhio mai: [He pātengi raraunga mahi tahi a Open Food Facts mō ngā hua kai](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/discover), kāore mātou e hoko i tētahi hua, ā, kāore hoki he hononga ki ō rātou kaihanga. For a question or complain about a product, you need to write directly to the producer (address on the product label).

---

## Is the information and data on products verified?

Nā ngā kaituhi o Open Food Facts i tuku mai ngā mōhiohio me ngā raraunga. The contributors also send pictures of the product, its labels, ingredients lists and nutrition facts table. When in doubt, visitors can thus check the accuracy by themselves, and if there is an error, they can correct it on the spot.

To detect potential errors more easily, we will progressively add automated checks. Hei tauira, mēnā he tino rerekē ngā meka kai o tētahi hua i ngā hua o te kāwai kotahi, tera pea he hapa. If the nutriments add up to more than 100%, it's definitely an error.

Finally, many producers send us photos and data about their products using our Platform for Producers. Mena he kaihanga koe, tēnā [whakapā mai](mailto:producers@openfoodfacts.org)

---

## I am a food product manufacturer, can I add my own products?

Yes! The only condition is to accept that the data and the pictures be made available under an open licence. (tirohia te [Ngā Tikanga o te Takoha](https://en.openfoodfacts.org/terms-of-use#contribution))

Kua whakawhanakehia e mātou he tūāpapa kore utu hei āwhina i a koe ki te kawemai i ngā whakaahua me ngā raraunga mō ō hua, ahakoa te rahi. It will let you import complete and up-to-date data and visuals into Open Food Facts that will be visible in more than 100 other nutritional apps. Additionaly, the platform provides suggestions to improve the Nutri-Score of your products. Whakapā mai ki a mātou ki te matapaki me pēhea tā mātou haere tonu: [producers@openfoodfacts.org](mailto:producers@openfoodfacts.org)
