Contributors are volunteers. Their contributions are gathered in an open database that can be used by everyone and for all uses. (tirohia ngā Ture mō te whakamahi anō)

Ka taea e te katoa (tae atu ki ngā kaituku me ngā kaihanga o Open Food Facts) te tohatoha anō me te whakamahi anō rānei i ngā raraunga hei hanga paetukutuku, ratonga, pūmanawa, taupānga pūkoro, hei tuhi tuhinga me ngā rangahau rānei. They are free to make the resulting work freely available, or to sell or monetize it (e.g. with ads), as long as they respect the terms of reuse.

We are also strictly independent from the food industry, and all the services and software we build are free. Hei tauira, he kore utu rawa tā mātou Pūhara mō ngā Kaihanga, ā, e nui atu ana tō mātou harikoa ki tēnā nā te mea e whakaaro ana mātou ka āwhina pea tēnei i a rātou ki te whakapai ake i ā rātou hua.
