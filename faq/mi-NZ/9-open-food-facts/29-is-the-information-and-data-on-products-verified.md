Nā ngā kaituhi o Open Food Facts i tuku mai ngā mōhiohio me ngā raraunga. The contributors also send pictures of the product, its labels, ingredients lists and nutrition facts table. When in doubt, visitors can thus check the accuracy by themselves, and if there is an error, they can correct it on the spot.

To detect potential errors more easily, we will progressively add automated checks. Hei tauira, mēnā he tino rerekē ngā meka kai o tētahi hua i ngā hua o te kāwai kotahi, tera pea he hapa. If the nutriments add up to more than 100%, it's definitely an error.

Finally, many producers send us photos and data about their products using our Platform for Producers. Mena he kaihanga koe, tēnā whakapā mai ki a mātou
