The main difference is for us a critical one: our data is freely available to all and for all uses. It's what is called open data.

Almost all other sites, services and applications forbid others from reproducting and reusing their data. Quite to the contrary, they jealously keep it for themselves. I te nuinga o ngā wā, e ārai mārama ana ā rātou tikanga ratonga i tētahi whakamahinga kore-whaiaro me te tango i ngā raraunga katoa, i ētahi wāhanga rānei o ngā raraunga.

We consider that food products information is too important and useful to keep it locked in a safe. Nō reira, i te tīmatanga o te kaupapa Open Food Facts me te taupānga pūkoro, i te tau 2012, i whakatau mātou ki te mahi i te ritenga kē: ehara i te mea ka whakaaetia e mātou te whakamahi me te whakamahi anō i tā mātou pātengi raraunga, he kore utu, he kore utu hoki, ki te katoa, mō ngā whakamahinga katoa (tae atu ki ngā mahi arumoni), engari ka akiakihia hoki e mātou!

Mā te whakawātea i ngā raraunga ki te marea (e mōhiotia ana ko ngā raraunga tuwhera), ka taea e ngā tāngata takitahi, ngā rōpū, ngā kamupene, ngā kairangahau me ētahi atu o te ao te whakaaro me te whakawhanake i ngā tono mō ngā raraunga kāore rawa i whakaarohia e tātou.
