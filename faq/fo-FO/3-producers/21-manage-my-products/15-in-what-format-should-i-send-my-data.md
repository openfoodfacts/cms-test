A template is provided by Open Food Facts.

However, any spreadsheet format (xlsx, csv) will be importable in the platform.Our algorithm is designed to automatically match the attributes from your file, with the ones present in Open Food Facts. Beware to always double-check the matching stage as you may need to adjust manually some of them.

If your information is fragmented between several spreadsheets, you can import them consecutively - making sure to do the matching if the format changes.

You can also import an Excel file in addition to an EQUADIS or AGENA3000 import, if the data is not yet in your information system. In these cases, don't forget to request an export to the public database from the interface.
