For legal and technical reasons, we don’t consider scraping prices from retailers’ websites as a valid way to contribute to Open Prices. We want to make sure that the prices we collect are accurate and up-to-date, and receiving scraped prices from contributors doesn’t allow us to do that.

Price scraping is a considered option in a future version of Open Prices, but it would be done by Open Prices itself so that we can have a proof of the price based on the HTML page.
