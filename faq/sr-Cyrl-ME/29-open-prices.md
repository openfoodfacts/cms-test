## I’m a retailer and I want to contribute prices. How can I do that?

## Do you consider scraping prices from retailers’ websites?

For legal and technical reasons, we don’t consider scraping prices from retailers’ websites as a valid way to contribute to Open Prices. We want to make sure that the prices we collect are accurate and up-to-date, and receiving scraped prices from contributors doesn’t allow us to do that.

Price scraping is a considered option in a future version of Open Prices, but it would be done by Open Prices itself so that we can have a proof of the price based on the HTML page.

## Why is Open Food Facts doing this (Open Prices)?

Price information is of paramount importance to understand food systems. It’s a key factor in understanding the cost of food and to promote healthier diets. Opening price data is a way to make it easier for researchers, journalists, and citizens to have a better understanding of how food prices vary geographically and in time.
