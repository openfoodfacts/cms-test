## Why is there no Nutri-Score for animals?

Each animal is different (a snake does not have the same nutritional needs as a cat or a dog)

Even within the same type of animal such as dogs, the nutritional needs vary according to the life of the sedentary lifestyle, a possible castration or diseases.

It is therefore complicated to calculate a score for animal feed without involving dozens of researchers and creating dozens of different algorithms, which has not been done to date.

## Where can I find the Open Pet Food Facts API ?

Open Pet Food Facts API is 98% the same as Open Food Facts API so if you use Open Food Facts API documentation you should have a pretty clear view of the Open Pet Food Facts API.

Note that features like the Knowledge Panels, Eco-Score, Nutri-Score are not supported (either due to the topic, or to the old codebase).
